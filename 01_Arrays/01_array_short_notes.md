# Arrays

- Array is a linear data structure where all elements are arranged sequentially. It is a collection of elements of same data type stored at contiguous memory locations. 
- Arrays at core are of fixed size only, but most of the languages provide dynamic sized arrays using the underlying fixed sized arrays
- Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, instead of declaring separate variables for each value.
- If declared globally, all elements are initialized to zero. If declared locally, elements are initialized to garbage values.

## Types of Arrays

1. **One Dimensional Array**: It is a list of elements where elements are stored in a sequential manner. It is also known as a vector.
2. **Two Dimensional Array**: It is a collection of rows and columns. It is also known as a matrix.
3. **Multi Dimensional Array**: It is an array of arrays. It is also known as a tensor.

## Array Operations

1. **Insertion**: Adding elements to the array.
2. **Deletion**: Removing elements from the array.
3. **Traversal**: Accessing each element of the array.
4. **Searching**: Finding the location of an element in the array.
5. **Sorting**: Arranging elements in a specific order.
6. **Merging**: Combining two arrays into one.
7. **Splitting**: Dividing one array into two.
8. **Updating**: Modifying the value of an element in the array.

## Difference between Array and Vector

- **Array**:
  - Fixed size.
  - Cannot change size after declaration.
  - Memory is allocated at compile time.
  - No built-in functions for array manipulation.
  - No bound checking.
  - Faster than vectors.

- **Vector**:
  - Dynamic size.
  - Can change size after declaration.
  - Memory is allocated at runtime.
  - Built-in functions for vector manipulation.
  - Bound checking.
  - Slower than arrays.
